		<h1>1969 Porsche 911</h1>
		
		<hr>
		
		<p>
		Porsche 911, arguably one of the most brilliantly engineered cars around. I picked this image because the car is one of my favorites. I think this car is what defines German engineering.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		The original reason I picked the spots for the map were because they seemed to be the most geometric fitting areas for them. The headlights and tire are circular in shape and made a nice complement to the area I had to create. The signals and emblem were almost perfect for the rectangular area for their shape as well. As I was going, I wanted to make sure they were big enough to find and click on, all while making sure they only covered specific portions of the car.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		While choosing the links I decided to go with a mixture of, history on the car and how they work, to the science behind why they work. On the driver side turn signal I linked the Utah laws for using turn signals. I used all of these links because they related back to the specific portion on the car. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		This is a car I personally love. Through it I wanted to share some other things I am interested in. These are the Sciences, History and overall how the things around me work. This specific car is one I hope to own one day, whether it is a shop car or already fixed up to drive around.
