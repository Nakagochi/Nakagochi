            <h1 class="text-center p-4 m-4" id="aboutMe">About me!</h1>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4"> My name is Tysen Christensen and I am a student at Salt lake community college. I am currently attending to earn an associates in Computer Science and Info Systems. When I graduate from here I plan on transferring up to the University of Utah.I
                have always had the dream of becoming a video game developer because I want to make someone happy. I guess you could say that my true dream is to bring joy to others through the skills I procure. I am currently dabbling in producing a
                small Discord bot for me and my friends while on the side messing with the p5 library for JavaScript. I think I may get the processing library and mess around with that too. Who knows what the world is to bring me? I sure as heck don’t.
            </p>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4"> Through my short life I have done a few things. My favorite is that I bowl. I won first, second and third in many bowling tournaments on the state, county, and city levels. I was also the captain of my high school's bowling team. Throughout
                high school I held a 180 average. Currently I am quite sad to say that I don’t bowl. I decided to take a few years off so I could focus on school and make sure my grades are good. When this is done I know I am going to take it up again.
            </p>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4"> Beyond that I am really into video games, computers and cooking. When I was really young I thought I wanted to be a professional chef. I joined the ProStart class, a class that trains students in professional cooking habits and skills, and
                joined my school’s competitive team. We didn’t make it far because of a few points knocked but it was fun and led to a different competition that I enjoyed more. After that I joined FCCLA (Family, Career and Community Leaders of America)
                and had an opportunity to be a team member in that year’s culinary competition. That was one of the more fun competitions I was a part of and I can say that I would probably do that again. We came in second place regionally in this competition
                but I don’t think it was really about the competition more so the experience.
            </p>
            <p class="pIndt pb-4 mb-4"> These lead me to gain a Diploma of Merit with focus in Family and Consumer Sciences and Math. I graduated with a 3.80 GPA and have a few college credits due to Advanced Placement classes I took. All of that has led me to where I am today.
                A full-time student trying to do the best I can. I take pride in the work I do and I want to make it look the best I can.

        <!--REFLECTION-->
        <div class="container-flex w-75 mx-auto my-5">
            <h1 class="text-center">Reflection</h1>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4">I always wanted to get a degree in Computer Science. I found joy in writing the logic behind programs in my previous classes and I still find the joy in that today. This class has shown me there is more to the computer science world than just
                logical programs. Through this class I learned that everything works together in one way or another when you produce something for others. I learned that the production of professional websites require more than just simple code I could
                write myself. This world of computers and programming shows that everyone is here for eachother. We all want to succeed in what we are doing.</p>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4">Through my research outside of the mandatory course work I found that API’s are extremely useful when you want to get large quantities of data out. The quote generator is run off of an API called Quotible by Luke Peavey. Learning how to apply
                this to my own code has taught me how jQuery works and the ways that it can be implemented in a site. Over this class my favorite assignment were the JavaScript ones. I enjoyed learning the different ways to encode solutions to the problem
                at hand and personalizing them to make them mine.
            </p>
            <p class="pIndt mb-4">This class has shown me that my dream of becoming a game developer may only be one of thousands of roles I could take. Web development is not about designing as much as it is creating something. Each web page I created had my own personal
                style to them and made me think about ways that I could change what I do. My workflow became defined in this class and I learned one of many ways to create a web page. Learning the back end of a website lets me really personalize and find
                what I could change to make it better. This class has been wonderfully insightful to me and taught me that websites are more than plane scripts.
